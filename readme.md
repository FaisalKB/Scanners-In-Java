# Scanners in Java

## About:
I will be documenting my Java Journey through GitHub Repositories to showcase my advancement in the language. As I went through learning JavaScript, Node and React, I found myself regretting not documenting and showing my advancement through the language. I aim to change that while I learn Java, and hope that once I become a great programmer and developer, I can look back and be reminded of my roots. 

Each ReadMe will include this about section, as well as a brief description of the repository, what it does and why it's important.

## Description:
Scanners allow us to accept information from the console. Using the built-in Scanner class, we can take in responses from the console and use them in our code! The first step to using the scanner is to import it from the java util package. We can easily do this by including ``` import java.util.Scanner; ``` at the top of our code. Then we can get user input from our keyboard and store it into a variable. We do this by creating a Scanner Object. A demonstration of this is included in the Main class.
